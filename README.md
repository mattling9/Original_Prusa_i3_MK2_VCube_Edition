## What is the Original Prusa i3 MK2 VCube Edition?

The name "VCube" is based on two factors. The 'V' Represents that the majority of the frame uses 20mmx40mm Black Anodised Aluminium Extrusions. The 'Cube' part of the name is because the frame resembles a cube. Simple.

### Key Features:

- Dramatically Increased Frame Strength
- Reduced Noise From the Printer
- Reduces Time and Effort to Calibrate the Printer.
- Can easily be Enclosed by Screwing on Any Sheet Material.
- Seperate Compartment to House Electronics, to Reduce Overheating.
- V-Slot Rails Provide Huge Customizability, Including Support For RPi-Camera, LED-Holders Ect..

The Original Prusa i3 MK2 VCube Edition uses as many parts as possible from the Original Prusa i3 MK2. A link to the Prusa Research© website can be found here: http://www.prusa3d.com/. I love the Original Prusa i3 MK2 and the high quality parts it uses, combined with cheap 3d printed parts to reduce the cost and make it affordable. Combine this with a lot of Research and Development from Prusa Research©, and you have a printer that can compete with £1000+ printers.

## Bill of Materials

Here are all of the materials i purchased for the build. I Purchased ALL of my parts together from [Ooznest](http://ooznest.co.uk/) in the UK. The company sold every part i needed at a very reasonable price all with Next Day Shipping. if you don't mind waiting 4-8 weeks shipping or you are outside the UK, i would suggest you can source your materials from places like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) or even [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/).

### Essentials

These are the parts essential to the build. There is no replacement or alternatives. The Aluminium Extrusions Can be any colour, i chose black to match my colour scheme. The M5 Bolts must be Low Profile in order to work with the Aluminium Cast Corners.

### Optional Parts

These parts are only optional and are not necessary to build the VCube Frame. I have purchased all of these parts for my build and i have exampled why with each part.

#### 3D Printed Cast Corners

|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| ![Cast Corner Photo](http://imgur.com/2n7YLVO.jpg) | Printed Cast Corner | ABS 90 DEGREE CAST CORNER | 16       | none  |

The Aluminium Cast Corners can be quite expensive, hterefore you can 3d print the Cast Corners. I have provided an .stl file for the cast corners in the Printed Parts folder. BEWARE, the printed ones are a lot weaker than the cast aluminium so i would advise not to use for printed ones for every corner. I use cast ones for the main construction of the frame and printed ones to hold the 2x 400mm Extrusions to mount the Y Axis on.

#### GT2 1 Meter Belt

| Image                                              | Reference           | Part                      | Quantity | Notes |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| ![GT2 Belt Photo](http://imgur.com/XVo3IL1.jpg) | GT2 Belt | [GT2 OPEN TIMGING BELT 1M](http://ooznest.co.uk/GT2-Timing-Belt) | 1       | Length: 1 Meter  |

The VCube design requires the X Motor to be moved about 40mm the the right. This means that the belt will have to be 40mm shorter than the original one. I did not want to cut my Original Pursa i3 MK2 belt, incase i wanted to put the printer back in the Original frame, so i purchased a new one. 1 Meter is the perfect length for the belt.

#### 10mm M5 Low Profile Bolts
| Image                                              | Reference           | Part                      | Quantity | Notes |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| ![10mm M5 Bolt Photo](http://imgur.com/b6xB2yK.jpg) | 10mm M5 Bolt | [10MM M5 LOW PROFILE BOLT](http://ooznest.co.uk/V-Slot/Bolts/Low-Profile-M5-Bolts) | As Many As You Want | Bolt Length: 10mm  |

In order to add additional printed parts to the frame, i am using 10mm M5 Low profile bolts. I chose 10mm over the original 8mm as it allowed me to have thicker, stronger printer parts to connect to the frame. An example of an 'Additional Part' is something like a camera mount for the PPi-Camera connected to Octoprint. **Remember to purchase more Tee-Nuts for the 10mm M5 nuts.**

#### NEMA17 Stepper Motor Dampener
| Image                                              | Reference           | Part                      | Quantity | Notes |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| ![NEMA17 Dampener Photo](http://imgur.com/b6xB2yK.jpg) | NEMA17 Dampener | [NEMA17 STEPPER MOTOR DAMPER](http://ooznest.co.uk/Stepper-Motor-Damper) | 2 or 4| Size: NEMA17  |

NEMA17 Stepper Motor Dampeners, reduce the vibration transmitted from the stepper motors into the frame. They have provided a huge difference in noise when connected to all of the axis. I have suggested '2 or 4' in the Quantity, because they are only really needed on the X and Y Axis which requires 2. You can put 2 on the Z axis but it will not make any difference during a normal print.
