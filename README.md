## What is the Original Prusa i3 MK2 VCube Edition?

The name "VCube" is based on two factors. The 'V' Represents that the majority of the frame uses 20mmx40mm Black Anodised Aluminium Extrusions. The 'Cube' part of the name is because the frame resembles a cube. Simple.

### Key Features:

- Dramatically Increased Frame Strength
- Reduced Noise From the Printer
- Reduces Time and Effort to Calibrate the Printer.
- Can easily be Enclosed by Screwing on Any Sheet Material.
- Seperate Compartment to House Electronics, to Reduce Overheating.
- V-Slot Rails Provide Huge Customizability, Including Support For RPi-Camera, LED-Holders Ect..

The Original Prusa i3 MK2 VCube Edition uses as many parts as possible from the Original Prusa i3 MK2. A link to the Prusa Research© website can be found here: http://www.prusa3d.com/. I love the Original Prusa i3 MK2 and the high quality parts it uses, combined with cheap 3d printed parts to reduce the cost and make it affordable. Combine this with a lot of Research and Development from Prusa Research©, and you have a printer that can compete with £1000+ printers.

## Bill of Materials

Here are all of the materials i purchased for the build. I Purchased ALL of my parts together from [Ooznest](http://ooznest.co.uk/) in the UK. The company sold every part i needed at a very reasonable price all with Next Day Shipping. if you don't mind waiting 4-8 weeks shipping or you are outside the UK, i would suggest you can source your materials from places like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/) or even [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/).

### Essentials

These are the parts essential to the build. There is no replacement or alternatives. The Aluminium Extrusions Can be any colour, i chose black to match my colour scheme. The M5 Bolts must be Low Profile in order to work with the Aluminium Cast Corners.
